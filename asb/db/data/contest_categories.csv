1,chain,Chain,1,"This attack grows more impressive with repetition, rather than less. As a result, the usual point penalty associated with using the same attack multiple times in a row does not apply to attacks with this class."
2,copycat,Copycat,1,"The Pokémon carefully watches its opponent and mimics its showmanship, earning bonus points equal to the total positive points that the last Pokémon to appeal did, plus ten."
3,crowd-fueled,Crowd Fueled,1,"These moves are more successful the more confident the Pokémon feels when using them. If it senses that the crowd likes it better than its opponent, it will put on an extra-impressive display. Appeals of this type earn ten points for every ten points the user has more than the highest-scoring opponent, up to sixty points."
4,extra-appealing,Extra-Appealing,1,"Pulling this difficult appeal off well earns extra marks from the judges, giving a 20-point bonus if it hits successfully but still earning the base number of points even if it fails for any reason."
5,foe-dependent,Foe-Dependent,1,"This appeal looks especially impressive when compared to a failed appeal on the part of an opponent. If a foe's last appeal scored fewer than 30 positive points, this attack earns an additional 60 points bonus. If the opponent earned exactly 30 points after all bonuses, this attack also earns 30 points, but if the opponent earned more than 30 points, this attack is worth nothing."
6,final-action-bonus,Final-Action Bonus,1,"This appeal is excellent for winding down a round and wrapping up a set of attacks. If this attack is used as a Pokémon's last action in a round, it earns 40 bonus points."
7,first-action-bonus,First-Action Bonus,1,"This appeal is a particularly impressive opener, setting the user up for a complicated routine. If a Pokémon uses an attack of this type for the first action of the round, it earns an additional 40 bonus points."
8,jealous,Jealous,1,"The Pokémon makes a spiteful appeal, putting its all into the performance in an attempt to outdo a particularly skilled opponent. If the last enemy Pokémon to appeal has the highest contest score in the match thus far, this appeal earns an additional 30 bonus points."
9,pure-points,Pure Points,1,"These appeals are fairly straightforward. They have no effect beyond earning positive points for the user and, potentially, negative points for the opponent as well."
10,random,Random,1,This attack is totally unpredictable and could go off very well or very poorly. The number of points it earns is totally random.
11,risky,Risky,1,"This attack poses actual danger to its user, as its execution leaves the Pokémon off-balance and vulnerable. If the next opponent's next appeal is directed against the Pokémon that made a risky attack, it loses twice the points it ordinarily would for a disruption."
12,sacrificial,Sacrificial,1,"These attacks are spectacular, if only because they carry such a horrifying side-effect. While a Pokémon will gain a huge points boost by using such a move, however, they will subsequently be knocked out and unable to participate in the remainder of the battle."
13,superpower,Superpower,1,"These appeals draw power from the residual energies of the attacks that have passed before them and share an elemental type. For each attack made thus far this round that shares a type with this attack, it gains 20 appeal points."
14,type-fueled,Type Fueled,1,"This attack looks especially good following up other attacks of its type. If the last attack used before this one was of the same type as it, this attack scores a bonus 40 points."
15,calming,Calming,2,"The Pokémon sets up a powerful defense, relaxing and preparing itself to deflect attempts at interruption from the opponent. This attack negates up to fifty negative points scored against this Pokémon, but the effect expires at the end of the round, even if it has blocked fewer than fifty points of disruption."
16,plus-condition,+Condition,2,"This appeal reinforces the user's condition, making it feel more secure and at home in the arena. In addition to providing points, these appeals reduce the user's nervousness level by 10% and add a * to their condition rating."
17,concentration,Concentration,2,"This appeal allows the Pokémon to focus itself, blocking out all distractions and refusing to allow its opponent to interfere with its performance. The next time a Pokémon using this attack would lose points this round, it loses no points instead."
18,minus-condition,−Condition,3,"This appeal degrades the foe's condition, enfeebling it. In addition to earning the user points, this appeal removes a * from the opponent or adds an X to their condition if they have no *'s. It also increases their nervousness by 10%."
19,crowd-distraction,Crowd Distraction,3,"Although it may not do much to impress the judges, this sort of appeal is sure to get the crowd's attention--and keep it off the other Pokémon on stage. For the duration of the round any appeals the target makes that are classified as ""crowd fueled"" earn only 10 points."
20,interruption,Interruption,3,"The Pokémon strikes with an attack sure to throw its opponent off-kilter, foiling whatever spectacular performance they'd been building up to. The more ambitious the target's appeal, the more this attack throws them off. If the last appeal the target made is one that earned it bonus points, this appeal docks additional points."
21,type-aligned,Type-Aligned,3,"This attack aims to outdo the efforts of Pokémon that have previously appealed by beating them at their own game. If this attack is the same type as an attack used by any opponent in this action, that opponent is jammed for an additional twenty bonus points."
22,ultrajam,UltraJam,3,"This appeal is not only extremely impressive, but also severely disrupts opponents. After using such a powerful attack, however, the Pokémon must spend an action resting."
23,vindictive,Vindictive,3,"The Pokémon sets out to punish the opponent for its success, paying more attention to tormenting it than to reinforcing its own position. The opponent loses an additional number of points equal to half of what it had earned with its last action."
24,deflating,Deflating,4,"This appeal makes the next foe Pokémon to appeal look significantly weaker and less intimidating, causing them to lose all ability to force nervousness checks for the duration of the round."
25,intimidating,Intimidating,4,"This appeal unsettles the opponents, making them question their capabilities and second-guess themselves. Use of such an appeal forces a nervousness check for all opponents after its use."
26,first-priority,First-Priority,5,"This appeal is blindingly fast, giving its user a burst of speed and allowing it to move first in the next action. If more than one Pokémon uses an attack of this nature in an action, they move in speed order at the beginning of the next action, before all other Pokémon that did not use first-priority attacks."
27,last-priority,Last-Priority,5,"This appeal is slow or requires the Pokémon to do a considerable amount of preparation to use it. As a result, the Pokémon will still be recovering from it while the opponent starts to take its next action, causing the user of such an attack to move last in the next action. If multiple Pokémon use such an attack, they proceed in speed order."
28,scrambling,Scrambling,5,"This attack is perplexing and throws off the rhythm of all other Pokémon involved in the battle. As a result, the order that Pokémon move in the next action is totally random."
29,crowd-favorite,Crowd Favorite,6,"Not actually described in the guide, but shows up in some moves."
30,condition-fueled,Condition Fueled,6,"Not actually described in the guide, but shows up in some moves."
31,order-dependent,Order Dependent,6,"Not actually described in the guide, but shows up in some moves."
