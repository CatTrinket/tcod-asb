Helps Swirlix evolve.","Gourmet Chantilly cream prepared with artesanal care, of such strongly sweet taste that even a nibble of it can inspire a burst of activity. A Pokémon holding this item has Sweet Veil in addition to all other abilities. If they already have Sweet Veil, however, they're doomed to make such a mess that they end up with Gooey, in addition to Sweet Veil and any other abilities."
173,ability-capsule,Ability Capsule,5,,Permanently switches a Pokémon between its two regular abilities.  One use.,"The pinnacle of scientific achievement, this small capsule is full of carefully balanced DNA altering implements. When it's consumed, it will change its user's buildup into something different, but still typical of the species as a whole. By using this item on a regular ability Pokémon, it will permanently change its ability to another regular ability available to its species. It cannot be used on Pokémon with only one regular ability."
174,assault-vest,Assault Vest,1,,"Multiplies damage taken from special moves by 2/3, but prevents the use of non-damaging moves.","Adapted from military gear, this bulletproof vest will absorb the brunt of many ranged attacks, but a model that can actually be worn comfortably by any Pokémon has yet to be developed. A Pokémon holding this item will become too irritated to use status moves, but will only receive two-thirds of the damage it ordinarily would take from special attacks."
175,fairy-gem,Fairy Gem,4,18,Multiplies a Fairy-type move's base damage by 1.5 and halves its energy cost.  One use per battle.,A bright pink gem that is notoriously rare and elusive to its seekers.

176,kee-berry,Kee Berry,6,41,Raises Defense by one stage when hit by a physical move.  One use per battle.,"A rare berry thought to be of the same family as the Liechi and Ganlon Berries. A Pokémon holding this item may, when struck by a foe's physical attack, consume it to gain a 1+ boost to its Defense."
177,luminous-moss,Luminous Moss,1,,Raises Special Defense by one stage when hit by a Water-type move.  One use per battle.,"A small sample of moss collected from the murky depths of a cave, where it thrives because of its ability to reflect and amplify light. The first time a Pokémon holding this item is struck by a Water-type attack, the moss moistens and spreads over its holder. Their Special Defense is then raised by one stage as the coverage aids in deflecting incoming energy. The item is considered consumed at this point, as the moss cannot provide better coverage with further watering."
178,maranga-berry,Maranga Berry,6,42,Raises Special Defense by one stage when hit by a special move.  One use per battle.,"This exotic berry is covered in soft spines that give it an unique, fuzzy texture. A Pokémon holding this item may, when struck by a foe's special attack, consume it to gain a 1+ boost to its Special Defense."
179,pixie-plate,Pixie Plate,3,18,Lowers Fairy-type moves' energy cost by 1%.  Makes Hidden Power Fairy-type.,"A light pink stone tabled infused with the power of the fey. Pokémon holding this item use 1% less energy to use damaging Fairy-type attacks. That Pokémon's Hidden Power attack becomes Fairy-type for as long as the plate is in its possession. If the plate should be removed, Hidden Power's type is randomized for the remainder of the battle."
180,roseli-berry,Roseli Berry,6,28,Lowers the effectiveness of Fairy-type moves on the user by one level for one round.  One use per battle.,"A fleshy carmine berry of recent discovery, its unusual taste currently known to very few. A Pokémon holding this item may consume it to reduce the effectiveness of Fairy-type attacks made against it by one stage for the round. (Thus, a 4x weakness to Fairy would become a 2x weakness to Fairy for one full round after a Roseli Berry was consumed.)"
181,safety-goggles,Safety Goggles,1,,Protects against weather damage and powder-based moves.,"A pair of thick goggles that protects the holder from particles rushing towards their eyes. A Pokémon holding this item is immune to powder-based moves and damage from weather, as if it had the ability Overcoat."
182,snowball,Snowball,1,,Raises Attack by one stage when hit by an Ice-type move.  One use per battle.,"A round, compact scoop of snow. The first time a Pokémon holding this item is struck by an Ice-type attack, they will be considered immune to Ice-type attacks as the snowball incorporates the ice into its girth. Their Attack then rises by one stage as the enlarged sphere establishes their elevated status as the kid with the biggest snowball around — that's right chumps it's me — after which the snowball crumbles away anticlimactically."
183,weakness-policy,Weakness Policy,1,,Raises Attack and Special Attack by one stage when hit by a super-effective move.  One use per battle.,"A cosmic contract of insurance that stipulates an exchange between one moment of weakness and one bout of strength. One time, when a Pokémon holding this item is struck by a move that deals super-effective damage to it, its Attack and Special Attack are each raised by one stage."
