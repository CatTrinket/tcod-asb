id,identifier,name,summary,description
1,stench,Stench,,"This Pokémon exudes a powerful, foul smell. It is so repugnant that other Pokémon in close proximity may be forced to spend time fighting off nausea. As a result, all contact attacks used by a Pokémon with this ability have a 10% chance to make the target flinch. This flinch chance stacks with any flinch chance inherent in the attack itself, as well as any of the attack's other secondary effects."
2,drizzle,Drizzle,,"This Pokémon wields an arcane power over the weather, bringing cloudy skies and rain with it wherever it goes. Heavy rain is triggered when this Pokémon is brought onto the field, and it will continue indefinitely even after the Pokémon leaves the field for any reason. However, the weather may be changed while this Pokémon is on the field, and the rain will not return after the other weather effect has ended unless the Pokémon with Drizzle is recalled and sent out again. This ability has no effect indoors or in areas where weather is normally banned completely, or where only rain dance is excluded."
3,speed-boost,Speed Boost,,"This Pokémon moves at a lightning pace, constantly accelerating to greater and greater speeds as it works up to its maximum velocity. As a result, its speed rises by one level at the end of each round. Regardless of these additional boosts as a result of the Speed Boost ability, this Pokémon's speed may never rise more than six levels."
4,battle-armor,Battle Armor,,"A Pokémon with this ability has thick natural armor that covers all of its weak spots. An opposing Pokémon will not be able to score any extra damage no matter where they strike this Pokémon. This ability blocks all ""critical hit"" effects."
5,sturdy,Sturdy,,This Pokémon is tough and built for endurance. It will not cave before overwhelming force. Pokémon with this ability cannot be knocked out by any attack that would have done more than 10% damage to them.
6,damp,Damp,,"This Pokémon keeps its skin constantly moist or slimy and can stop an explosion simply by touching the Pokémon or object that is about to explode and allowing their natural dampness to prevent the necessary combustion from occurring. While this Pokémon is on the field, attempts at using explosion or selfdestruct are futile, and this Pokémon may also be commanded to take an action to counter the explosive effects of some Pokémon attacks such as egg bomb, rendering them harmless."
7,limber,Limber,,"This Pokémon's body is lithe and supple. It boasts an excellent control of its muscles, enabling it to to remain in command of them even after normally debilitating electric or toxic spore attacks, preventing this Pokémon from ever being paralyzed."
8,sand-veil,Sand Veil,,"Coming from a desert home, this Pokémon is naturally adapted to not only ride out sandstorms, but to thrive in them, and has learned how to use the blowing sand to conceal its movements. Pokémon with this ability are not only immune to all effects of sandstorm, including the normal drop in accuracy while trapped within one, but can conceal themselves in the blowing sand so well that the opponent suffers a 10% accuracy reduction when attempting to strike it, in addition to whatever accuracy penalty it might suffer for being caught in the sandstorm to begin with."
9,static,Static,,"This Pokémon stores static electricity in its skin or fur, causing charge to constantly ripple across the surface of its body. If an opposing Pokémon makes contact with a Pokémon with this ability, they are liable to get a nasty shock when touching its charged coat, which has a 30% chance of resulting in paralysis."
10,volt-absorb,Volt Absorb,,"Unlike most Pokémon, those with this ability can actually harness the electrical energy in attacks made against them and use it to fuel their own strikes. Whenever struck by an opponent's electrical attack, this Pokémon will automatically recapture the energy used to generate it, negating all damage and additional effects from the attack and replenishing their own energy by 1% for each 10 points of base power that the attack had, or 1% for non-damaging attacks. If there is a source of free electricity available on the battlefield, a Pokémon with this ability may be commanded to spend an action absorbing electricity from this power source, resulting in a 5% energy gain."
11,water-absorb,Water Absorb,,"This Pokémon has particularly porous skin, allowing it to soak up water in the environment at will or even absorb the water utilized by attacks made against it. Instead of taking damage when struck by an opponent's water-type attack, the Pokémon with this ability regains 1% HP for each 10 points of base power attributed to the attack by which it was struck. For water-type attacks that cause no damage, 1% HP is regained, and no secondary effects of any water-type attacks will have any effect on a Pokémon with water absorb. This Pokémon may also, in an arena where standing water is available, take an action to soak up some of the surrounding liquid to regain 5% HP without the use of energy. However, if a Pokémon with this ability should absorb tainted water for any reason, it will lose HP instead of gain it and has a 10-30% chance of becoming poisoned, depending upon the concentratin of chemicals in the water."
12,oblivious,Oblivious,,"This Pokémon is a bit dull and slow-witted, unable to catch on to the subtle hints put out by a Pokémon using attract. As a result, they cannot be attracted. However, they may still be infatuated through an opposing Pokémon's ability or through the secondary effect of an attack."
13,cloud-nine,Cloud Nine,,"This Pokémon exudes an aura of peace and tranquility, one so powerful that it is actually able to calm the turbulence of unnatural weather conditions and return the arena to a neutral state. As long as the Pokémon with this ability is on the field, weather effects are totally nullified. This applies even to persistent terrain effects, for example causing a normally constant sandstorm in a desert arena to temporarily subside. However, the range of this ability is quite limited--it can only neutralize unusual weather within an area of approximately fifty square feet, enough to encompass an arena but not the entire area of the weather effect. Thus, in the sandstorm example used before, the sandstorm would continue to rage around an area of calm produced by this ability. For this reason, the weather can still be changed by either battler while this ability is in effect, but will cause no effective change to arena conditions until the Pokémon with this ability leaves the arena for any reason, ending this ability's effects."
14,compound-eyes,Compound Eyes,,"The faceted structure of this Pokémon's eyes allows it to see the world from numerous angles at once. This allows for precise aim, translating into a 15% increase in base accuracy for all attacks made by this Pokémon."
15,insomnia,Insomnia,,"For one reason or another, this Pokémon finds it nearly impossible to fall asleep under normal circumstances, and absolutely impossible in the high-adrenaline context of battle."
16,color-change,Color Change,,"This Pokémon is adept at rapidly changing the color and texture of its skin in order to blend in with its surroundings. Not only that, but it can alter the chemical composition of its skin to match the properties of any sort of energy that it touches. This response is involuntary when the Pokémon in question undergoes pain, and therefore it will change its type to match the type of whatever damaging move by which it is struck."
17,immunity,Immunity,,"Since infancy, this Pokémon has been exposed to a great variety of toxins and has over time developed a powerful resistance to almost all forms of poison. As a result, there is no Pokémon attack in existence that can cause this Pokémon to earn the ""poisoned"" or ""severely poisoned"" status."
18,flash-fire,Flash Fire,,"This Pokémon is not only immune to heat, but is empowered by it. If struck by another Pokémon's fire-type attack, this Pokémon will use the resulting burst of heat to power up its own fire-type attacks instead of being harmed by it. This effectively raises the base power level of all its fire-type moves by ten until the end of the battle. The Pokémon is always immune to fire-type attacks, but can only achieve the power boost once."
19,shield-dust,Shield Dust,,"A thick cloud of choking powder surrounds this Pokémon, one that dampens elemental energies and prevents the added side effects of all offensive moves from affecting the Pokémon thus protected."
20,own-tempo,Own Tempo,,"This Pokémon marches to the beat of a different drummer, and with a quirky, distorted perception of the world is able to avoid the effects of confusion simply by not comprehending them as do normal Pokémon."
21,suction-cups,Suction Cups,,"This Pokémon has numerous suction cups on its underside, allowing it to cling to almost any surface with an incredible grip. It is nigh-impossible to budge a Pokémon with this ability through any means, although as a trade-off for this implacableness they are, naturally, extremely unmaneuverable."
22,intimidate,Intimidate,,"This Pokémon is daunting or ferocious in appearance and makes a frightening entrance, making opponents hesitate to attack it. When this Pokémon is sent onto the field, all opposing Pokémon, becoming intimidated, have their attack reduced by one level. Later in the battle, if this Pokémon fails to live up to its scary appearance, its opponents may have their confidence restored and lose this drop in attack. Even with this attack reduction, a Pokémon's attack may never be reduced by more than six levels. Pokémon sent into battle while a Pokémon with intimidate is already on the field do not suffer this ability's effects."
23,shadow-tag,Shadow Tag,,"An eerie power keeps all opposing Pokémon on the field with a Pokémon of this ability from fleeing, constraining them to move about only within the confines of the arena."
24,rough-skin,Rough Skin,,"Pokémon with this ability have exceptionally rough, pebbly skin that is so abrasive that even running a hand along it can lead to torn skin and bleeding palms. Any Pokémon making a contact attack against a Pokémon that has this ability, therefore, will take 2% recoil damage, even if the attack used is not directly damaging. This recoil is not prevented by the rock head ability. In addition, when this Pokémon makes a contact attack against an opponent, the damage is increased by 1% for the effects of rough skin."
25,wonder-guard,Wonder Guard,,"This Pokémon is protected by an unearthly power, its fragile body surrounded by an invisible wall of great force that will deflect all but the most powerful of attacks. This Pokémon takes no damage and does not suffer secondary effects from any attack which is not super-effective against it, but at the same time is more susceptible to super-effective attacks, taking 2x damage from attacks to which it has one level of weakness and 4x the normal damage from attacks to which it has a double weakness."
26,levitate,Levitate,,This Pokémon is considered to be inherently hovering (see the appropriate section of the rules for further details).
27,effect-spore,Effect Spore,,"A Pokémon with this ability stores a large quantity of status-inducing spores within its body, usually in a mushroom of some sort. Whenever an opponent strikes a Pokémon with this ability with a contact attack, it will inadvertently cause the release of a small cloud of these spores, which have a 30% chance of inflicting the attacker with either poison, paralysis, or sleep at random."
28,synchronize,Synchronize,,"This Pokémon's abilities allow it to balance out its mental and physical state with that of an opponent. When stricken by poisoning, a burn, or paralysis, this Pokémon will align its physical state with that of its opponent, conferring upon them the illusion that they are affected by the same status condition that they had inflicted on the Pokémon with synchronize, at the same level of severity. This ability has no effect on Pokémon who cause status conditions to which their type or species is immune (for example, a fire-type cannot be burned by this ability)."
29,clear-body,Clear Body,,"A Pokémon with this ability has an unusually powerful connection between mind and body, and even under stressful or painful conditions will be able to keep its cool and clear its body of any physiological response to an opponent's attacks. For this reason, attempts by the opponent to reduce this Pokémon's stats will fail, and attacks used against this Pokémon with secondary effects that would normally cause stat reductions will never have their secondary effects trigger."
30,natural-cure,Natural Cure,,"Endowed with a powerful immune system, this Pokémon can recover from normally debilitating status conditions easily if only given a small amount of time for rest. As a result, if these Pokémon leave the field for any reason and then enter again later, they will return without whatever status afflictions might have troubled them upon their leaving. Alernatively, a Pokémon with this ability may devote a full round to simply relaxing and allowing this ability to work, allowing them to recover from any status condition without the expenditure of energy (confusion and attraction excepted)."
31,lightning-rod,Lightning Rod,,"A Pokémon with this ability generally is tall or has some prominent feature that will draw lightning strikes, and it has adapted to use the energy conferred by such strikes to fuel their own attacks. These Pokémon are always the ones to be struck by an electrical attack aimed in their general direction, allowing them to draw attacks away from partners or other Pokémon in the area, and they are immune to all of their effects. However, as a result of electricity's attraction to them, an electric attack aimed even only in their general direction is likely to strike true. If a non-ground-type with this ability is struck by an electric-type attack, its special attack will also rise one level."
32,serene-grace,Serene Grace,,"A strange aura of potential surrounds this Pokémon, an unnatural island of calm and peace. Pokémon with this ability are extremely lucky, and any secondary effects of any move that they use are twice as likely to take effect."
33,swift-swim,Swift Swim,,"This Pokémon is unusually adept at swimming and otherwise moving through wet environments. Consequently, when an arena becomes drenched by the rain, such a Pokémon enjoys ease of movement much greater than normal, causing their base speed to double for the duration of the rain. These Pokémon also have their speed doubled when moving through water, whether or not it is raining."
34,chlorophyll,Chlorophyll,,"This Pokémon's cells contain an unusually high number of chloroplasts, the organelles that capture energy from sunlight. In particularly sunny arenas (ones in which sunny day is considered to be in effect), this Pokémon will be able to generate much more energy than normal through photosynthesis. This will naturally make the Pokémon much more energetic, effectively doubling its base speed until the intensified sunlight should fade, if ever."
35,illuminate,Illuminate,,"This Pokémon constantly generates light, illuminating the arena for an area of up to twenty square feet. As a result, it negates all effects of dark arenas or attacks that cause darkness for all Pokémon, including itself, within range of the light. Also, as looking directly into the light produced by this Pokémon is somewhat blinding, all ranged attacks made against this Pokémon have their accuracy reduced by 5%. Of course, the light is only brighter close up, and all contact moves made against a Pokémon with this ability have their accuracy reduced by 10%."
36,trace,Trace,,"Those Pokémon that are extremely empathetic can use this ability to reach out with their minds and acquire, for the duration of the battle, the unique traits (ability) expressed by their opponent. This ability triggers when the Pokémon with trace is first sent into battle but not after. If there are multiple Pokémon on the field, the ability that this Pokémon traces is random but will always come from an opponent rather than an ally."
37,huge-power,Huge Power,,"This Pokémon is big and bulky, able to throw its weight behind its attacks in order to produce more damage, and as a result all the physical attacks it makes, regardless of type, have their base power multiplied by 1.2. However, getting that much mass moving requires an unusually high expenditure of energy, and a Pokémon with this ability will expend 1% more than the normal amount of energy whenever it makes a move."
38,poison-point,Poison Point,,"This Pokémon's body is covered in numerous sharp spikes or has a horn(s) that secretes a deadly poison. When a Pokémon uses a contact attack on a Pokémon with this ability, it is possible that they might accidentally impale themselves on the poisonous spike or spikes, translating to a 30% chance of being poisoned upon making successful contact with Pokémon of this ability."
39,inner-focus,Inner Focus,,"As a result of stringent meditative training, this Pokémon retains a sense of deep inner calm that bolsters it and prevents it from being daunted and shying away as a result of a surprising attack. Startling attacks have no effect on a Pokémon with this ability. Effectively, this ability prevents ""flinching."""
40,magma-armor,Magma Armor,,"Instead of blood, this Pokémon's veins are filled with superheated, viscous magma. This causes its body temperature to be incredibly high, so high that no ice will be able to freeze to its skin and preventing it from ever being frozen."
41,water-veil,Water Veil,,"This Pokémon always keeps its skin cool and moist, so that even when struck by a flame attack, any singed skin will be rehydrated quickly and burns will be prevented from developing. As a result, a Pokémon with this ability cannot be burned."
42,magnet-pull,Magnet Pull,,"Pokémon with this ability have a powerful electromagnet in their bodies that can be turned on or off at will, allowing them to rein in any attempts of a steel-type Pokémon to escape by trapping them in the magnetic field. Also, this ability may be used as a standard action to discover the location of a concealed steel-type enemy, as it will lead the user unerringly towards the largest area of metal in the vicinity, the steel-type Pokémon, or an action may be taken to drag the steel-type Pokémon towards the user through the power of magnetism. If, however, the user weighs less than the opponent it is trying to drag, it will end up being the one pulled to its opponent instead of the other way around."
43,soundproof,Soundproof,,"This Pokémon, whether through making a constant ruckus of its own or by intentionally blocking out all sound from its environment, is unable to hear and be affected by any attacks that require sound in order to work, with the exception of heal bell."
44,rain-dish,Rain Dish,,"This Pokémon is able to collect and absorb rainwater, causing it to gain 1% health and energy after every round during which it was raining."
45,sand-stream,Sand Stream,,"This Pokémon wields an arcane power over the weather, bringing lashing winds and clouds of swirling sand with it wherever it goes. When released onto the field, this Pokémon lets out a mighty roar, summoning a raging gale to it, which then picks up the sand or grit native to the arena and blows it around. A sandstorm is triggered when this Pokémon is brought onto the field, and will continue indefinitely even after it leaves the field for any reason. However, the weather may be changed while this Pokémon is on the field, and the sandstorm will not return after the other weather effect has ended unless the Pokémon with Sand Stream is recalled and sent out again. This ability has no effect in areas where weather is normally banned completely, or where only sandstorm is excluded."
46,pressure,Pressure,,"Pokémon with this ability are recognized as being unusually powerful or otherwise dangerous, making Pokémon sent out into battle against them exceedingly nervous and causing them to use extra energy in order to force themselves to attack the Pokémon with this ability. As a result, a Pokémon uses 1.2x the normal amount of energy when attempting to use any attack that directly affects the Pokémon with this ability."
47,thick-fat,Thick Fat,,"This Pokémon has an extensive layer of fat or blubber that provides it insulation against the elements. As a result, the damage dealt by ice- and fire-type attacks on Pokémon with this ability is halved."
48,early-bird,Early Bird,,"Pokémon with the early bird ability are light and restless sleepers, causing them to awaken from slumber much more quickly than normal Pokémon."
49,flame-body,Flame Body,,"This Pokémon's body is entirely or partially covered with live fire, making them, naturally, very hot to the touch. Any Pokémon that makes contact with a Pokémon with this ability has a 30% chance of being burned as a result."
50,run-away,Run Away,,"To put it nicely, this Pokémon is exceptionally skilled at retreating, so much so that it can even escape Pokémon with Arena Trap, Shadow Tag, Magnet Pull, or similar abilities and leave the field if recalled. In addition, it has a greater chance of dodging attacks than a normal Pokémon would if commanded to do so."
51,keen-eye,Keen Eye,,"This Pokémon has particularly sharp, clear vision, and is able to quickly overcome attempts to blind it. This Pokémon's accuracy may not be reduced by any means."
52,hyper-cutter,Hyper Cutter,,"This Pokémon always keeps its claws, fangs, pincers, or other battle implements honed to a lethal cutting edge, so that their physical strikes will always deal at least standard damage, even if wielded with more timidity than usual. Effectively, this Pokémon's attack cannot be reduced."
53,pickup,Pickup,,"This Pokémon is resourceful and quick to make use of whatever its opponent chooses to discard. If a Pokémon with this ability isn't holding an item when an opponent uses a consumable item, it will dart in to grab the dropped item after the fact and begin holding it. When the time comes--immediately, if it already fulfills the conditions for the item's use--it will be able to squeeze another use out of its pilfered prize. Pokémon with this ability will also recover any items flung at them if they aren't holding anything at the time. Items acquired this way are lost at the end of battle."
54,truant,Truant,,"This Pokémon is lazy and would prefer to lounge around rather than attack. As a result, this Pokémon will refuse to do anything for one action out of every round, and will instead simply lounge around, doing nothing. The owner of this Pokémon may choose to let it ""slack off"" for any one of the three actions in a round, during which time it will do nothing but regain 5% energy. If the trainer provides commands for all three actions of a round, the truant Pokémon will ignore one of them at random and slack off instead. Nevertheless, the Pokémon with this ability are quite powerful when they actually do shift themselves to fight, and as a result cause an extra 2% damage with all their damaging attacks, regardless of type."
55,hustle,Hustle,,"A Pokémon with this trait is adept at attacking quickly and recklessly, which results in greater power but a greater chance of failure. All attacks used by this Pokémon, of any type, have their base power multiplied by 1.2, but all attacks used by this Pokémon have their accuracy reduced by 20%."
56,cute-charm,Cute Charm,,"A Pokémon with this ability has an appeal that simply can't be denied. If a Pokémon of the opposite gender attempts to strike this Pokémon with a contact attack, there is a 30% chance that they will suffer a change of heart and fall deeply in love with this Pokémon upon completing the attack. The effects of this ability, when successful, are identical to those caused by the move attract, and the effectiveness of this ability decreases considerably each time that the foe becomes attracted but then falls out of attraction, as he or she is not likely to fall for the same trick multiple times."
57,plus,Plus,,"This Pokémon's body is positively charged. If it should be on the field at the same time as a Pokémon with the Minus ability, the electrical potential between the two will excite and energize them, causing all special-type attacks used by either Pokémon to have their base power multiplied by 1.5, regardless of type. This ability triggers immediately when the Plus Pokémon is put on the field with the Minus Pokémon, and turned off as suddenly when the Minus Pokémon leaves the field for any reason."
58,minus,Minus,,"This Pokémon's body is negatively charged. If it should be on the field at the same time as a Pokémon with the Plus ability, the electrical potential between the two will excite and energize them, causing all special-type attacks used by either Pokémon to have their base power multiplied by 1.5, regardless of type. This ability triggers immediately when the Minus Pokémon is put on the field with the Plus Pokémon, and turned off as suddenly when the Plus Pokémon leaves the field for any reason."
59,forecast,Forecast,,"Engineered to predict the weather, this Pokémon transforms when it senses any change in atmospheric conditions. If rain is imminent, it will become a water-type and take on an appropriately-shaped form. Similarly, it will change to an ice-type if hail is detected or a fire-type in the presence of sunny day. As soon as the weather attack ends, this Pokémon reverts back to its normal form. It is not affected by sandstorm, and the transformation does not require a full action or any energy investment to perform."
60,sticky-hold,Sticky Hold,,"When this Pokémon grabs an enemy, item, or other object, its grip is made extremely strong by a foul, mucosoid excretion that coats its hands. It is therefore extremely difficult for an opponent (or ally) to escape the grasp of a Pokémon with this ability and for any item to be wrenched out of the hands of a Pokémon with this ability."
61,shed-skin,Shed Skin,,"This Pokémon is accustomed to sluffing off old skin in order to grow, and it can by the same process slough off negative status conditions (excluding attraction and confusion). At the end of each round, there is a 30% chance that a Pokémon with this ability will have succeeded in shedding whatever negative status condition(s) by which it might have been afflicted. In addition, a Pokémon may be commanded to spend two actions actively working to shed its skin, which will cure all non-confusion, non-attraction status conditions at a cost of 5% energy."
62,guts,Guts,,"A Pokémon with guts is exceedingly tough and not easily daunted by minor setbacks. If anything, it has the ability to feed off adversity and grow stronger as a result. When a Pokémon with guts is afflicted by any status condition excluding attraction and confusion, the base power of all its physical attacks, of any type, is multiplied by 1.5, but the extra effort put into their usage causes them to cost 2% more energy. This effect ceases if the Pokémon should ever recover its status, but may be triggered again later by another affliction."
63,marvel-scale,Marvel Scale,,"This Pokémon is covered with lustrous scales imbued with magical powers. When a Pokémon with this ability suffers from a status condition excluding confusion or attraction, the danger to its life will activate the magical spell hidden within its scales. The scales produce a magical aura of tranquility and protection that, effectively, has the same effects as reflect but consumes 1% energy each action that it is in effect. Reflect may still be used while this ability is triggered, and the effects of the two screens will stack."
64,liquid-ooze,Liquid Ooze,,"Within this Pokémon's body their circulates a foul, poisonous liquid. Should any Pokémon attempt to drink the blood of an opponent with this ability or otherwise drain health from it, they are certain to take up a bit of poison as well as blood. As a result, all HP or energy sapped from a Pokémon with this ability will damage the user of the draining attack instead of healing them."
65,overgrow,Overgrow,,"This Pokémon has a reserve of extra energy deep within itself that it cannot call upon except in times of greatest need. When severely wounded, this Pokémon is able to call forth its hidden power and, glowing green with unbridled grass-type energy, make grass-type attacks that are 1.5x more powerful than normal. When a Pokémon with this ability falls below 33% health, this ability activates, but if the Pokémon should eventually rise above 33% at any time or for any reason, this ability falls out of effect."
66,blaze,Blaze,,"Pokémon with blaze have a deep inner reserve of strength that they can only call upon in times of great need. When severely injured, these Pokémon can unlock their hidden power, glowing red with fire energy that will allow them to produce unusually powerful flame attacks. When a Pokémon with this ability falls below 33% health, this ability activates, effectively raising the base power of all the fire-type attacks this Pokémon uses by 1.5x. If the Pokémon's HP should rise to back above 33% at any time and for any reason, this ability falls out of effect."
67,torrent,Torrent,,"Pokémon with torrent have a deep, inner reserve of strength that they can only call upon in times of great need. When severely injured, these Pokémon can unlock their hidden power, glowing blue with water energy that will allow them to produce unusually powerful water attacks. When a Pokémon with this ability falls below 33% health, this ability activates, effectively raising the base power of all the water-type attacks this Pokémon uses by 1.5x. If the Pokémon's HP should rise to back above 33% at any time or for any reason, this ability falls out of effect."
68,swarm,Swarm,,"This Pokémon has a deep connection with a hive mind of some sort, although normally being captured and taken far from its home diminishes its connection with its fellow bugs. However, when in grave danger the Pokémon will be able to reach deep inside itself and call on the power of the hive. When this Pokémon falls below 33% health, its body glows an acid green color and the base power of its bug-type attacks are multiplied by 1.5 as they are backed up by the strength of the swarm. If the Pokémon's HP should rise to back above 33% at any time or for any reason, this ability falls out of effect."
69,rock-head,Rock Head,,"This Pokémon sports a naturally tough, helmetlike head that can absorb shock and stress without damage. As a result, Pokémon with this ability will not take recoil damage from any attacks that would normally cause it, using their armored heads to absorb the force of their own attack when it is turned against them."
70,drought,Drought,,"This Pokémon wields an acrane power over the weather, clearing away clouds and intensifying the sunlight wherever it goes. Bright sunlight is triggered when this Pokémon is brought onto the field, and it will continue indefinitely even after the Pokémon leaves the field for any reason. However, the weather may be changed while this Pokémon is on the field, and the bright sunlight will not return after the other weather effect has ended unless the Pokémon with Drought is recalled and sent out again. This ability has no effect indoors or in areas where weather is normally banned completely, or where only sunny day is excluded."
71,arena-trap,Arena Trap,,"A Pokémon with this ability is extremely capable of moving about in its environment and is easily able to maneuver around an opponent to block them from escaping the arena. However, being flightless, the Pokémon with this ability are not able to block the efforts of a flying or levitating Pokémon to escape. While a Pokémon with this ability is in play, no other Pokémon may leave the arena, unless they are listed as either flying or levitating Pokémon and thus able to avoid being trapped by this ability. In addition, it is much more difficult to dodge attacks made by these Pokémon, and attacks that require a great deal of movement, such as double team or agility, may be blocked by this Pokémon if it is commanded to do so, as they are able to move very rapidly to obstruct the opponent's path."
72,vital-spirit,Vital Spirit,,"This Pokémon has a deep love for battle and cannot rest when the prospect of further conflict is presented. This Pokémon, therefore, cannot be put to sleep during battle, and it will be reluctant to chill or do nothing unless extremely tired, preferring instead to go all-out whenever possible."
73,white-smoke,White Smoke,,"By constantly burning fuel, this Pokémon shrouds itself in a perpetual cloud of dense, pale smoke. This protective buffer does little to conceal the Pokémon's position, but does manage to create a zone of comfort within which it will not be susceptible to stat reductions, quite similar to a perpetual mist attack. As a result, this Pokémon is not affected by stat-reducing attacks used by the opponent, and attacks which have stat reductions as secondary effects will not have their extra effects trigger when used by an opponent against this Pokémon."
74,pure-power,Pure Power,,"This Pokémon's power wells up from deep within, imbuing their every action with extra grace and energy. In battle, the base power of all this Pokémon's offensive physical attacks, regardless of type, is multiplied by 1.2 but, as a result of the draining effects that constantly utilizing this power has on the body, all attacks used by this Pokémon consume 1% more than the normal amount of energy."
75,shell-armor,Shell Armor,,"This Pokémon has a thick, resilient shell that covers all of its weak spots. An opposing Pokémon will not be able to deal extra damage no matter where it strikes a Pokémon with this ability. Effectively, this prevents ""critical hits."""
76,air-lock,Air Lock,,"This Pokémon wields an arcane power over the weather, allowing it to prevent meteorological conditions from having any effect on the Pokémon in battle. This applies even to persistent terrain effects, for example causing a normally constant sandstorm in a desert arena to temporarily subside. However, the range of this ability is quite limited--it can only neutralize unusual weather within an area of approximately fifty square feet, enough to encompass an arena but not the entire area of the weather effect. Thus, in the sandstorm example used before, the sandstorm would continue to rage around an area of calm produced by this ability. For this reason, the weather can still be changed by either battler while this ability is in effect, but will cause no effective change to arena conditions until the Pokémon with this ability leaves the arena for any reason or the effects of this ability are otherwise nullified."
77,tangled-feet,Tangled Feet,,"This Pokémon has a wobbly, unsteady gait when it is dazed, causing it to avoid some attacks aimed at it to miss simply because this Pokémon happens to stagger out of the way by accident as they attempt to remain upright. As a result, when Pokémon with tangled feet are confused, attacks made against them have their accuracy reduced by 10%."
78,motor-drive,Motor Drive,,"This Pokémon's muscular system is adapted so that, rather than being disrupted by alien bursts of electricity, it is able to harness them and use them to its advantage. As a result, if this Pokémon is struck by an opponent's electric attack it will suffer neither damage nor any side-effects of the attack and instead increase its speed by one level as it utilizes the energy of the attack to fuel its movements."
79,rivalry,Rivalry,,"This Pokémon is intensely competitive and can't stand to be outdone by anybody--and certainly not one of its closest rivals! If in battle against a Pokémon of the same gender, Pokémon with this ability will be goaded into showing off a bit, performing more powerfully than they ordinarily would. As a result, the base power of all their damaging attacks is multiplied by 1.25 if the number of opponents of the same sex as the Pokémon with rivalry is greater than or equal to the number of opponents of the opposite sex as the Pokémon with rivalry. At the same time, Pokémon with this ability have somewhat of a soft spot for Pokémon of the opposite sex, and will be too distracted by them to fight as effectively when they're around. As a result, if the number of opponents of the opposite sex of the Pokémon with rivalry is greater than the number of opponents of the same sex, the base power of all this Pokémon's damaging attacks is multiplied by 0.75 instead. If all opponents are genderless, this ability has no effect on the Pokémon's power."
80,steadfast,Steadfast,,"This Pokémon has an indomitable spirit, and it will persevere even in the face of extreme hardship. Temporary setbacks only strengthen its resolve to up its performance. As a result, if this Pokémon is hit by an attack that causes it to flinch, its speed is raised one level as it throws its all into the battle, looking to overtake the opponent so that they will not be able to interrupt its attack again."
81,snow-cloak,Snow Cloak,,"Well adapted to a harsh, wintry environment, this Pokémon is able to hide itself to great effect in the chaos of blowing snow or falling hail, camouflaging itself cunningly amidst the snow and ice. Opponents attempting to attack a Pokémon with this ability while a hailstorm is in play have their accuracy reduced by 10% in addition to any other reductions in accuracy they might suffer as a result of the weather."
82,gluttony,Gluttony,,"This Pokémon is greedy to the extreme such that it always has to have the most of everything, and have it fast. Thus, a Pokémon with this ability only has to wait half as long for effects based upon health percentage to take effect or, alternatively, those effects are triggered at twice the normal health percentage. Therefore, it takes only 10% of their health to achieve the full effects of belly drum; flail has 200 base power beginning at 10% health instead of 5%, and so on."
83,anger-point,Anger Point,,"This Pokémon has an extremely volatile temper and is prone to fits of sudden and uncontrollable rage. It just takes the right trigger to send this Pokémon on a rampage--and that trigger happens to be a critical hit. If a Pokémon with anger point is struck by a critical hit, it will fly into a blind rage over the insolence and unbelievable luck (hax) of its opponent. This causes its physical attack to instantly max out in response to a critical hit, although it also causes the Pokémon to consume energy 1.5x faster for all damaging attacks as it strikes with reckless abandon."
84,unburden,Unburden,,"This Pokémon fights best when unencumbered, and special equipment would only bog it down in the heat of battle. As a result, if this Pokémon is not holding an item, its base speed is doubled."
85,heatproof,Heatproof,,"This Pokémon's body is forged of a special alloy, one designed to be extremely resistant to heat. As a result, this Pokémon's susceptibility to fire is one stage lower than usual for its typing. For example, a Pokémon weak to fire would take neutral damage from fire attacks while it had this ability, and a Pokémon resistant to fire would become doubly-resistant."
86,simple,Simple,,"This Pokémon is not one for complexity or nuance, but when it comes to straightforward emotions and simple commands, it's ready to give 100%. As a result, this Pokémon gets double the benefit from all the stat boosts that it earns--but at the same time is twice as susceptible to stat reductions! Thus a Pokémon with simple that used dragon dance would get +2 attack and +2 speed, but it would get -2 attack from the intimidate ability rather than the usual -1 attack."
87,dry-skin,Dry Skin,,"This Pokémon must keep its skin moist in order to breathe properly, with the result that this Pokémon is rejuvenated by exposure to rain or other sources of water such that it will regain 1% HP for each action spent in the rain or submerged in clean water. Tainted water, will instead cause the loss of 1% HP per action that the Pokémon with dry skin is exposed to it. In addition, Pokémon with dry skin can soak up water attacks made by other Pokémon without incurring any damage or suffering any of their detrimental side-effects, instead regaining health equal to half the damage they would otherwise have taken from the attack. There's a downside to all this, though! If a Pokémon with dry skin becomes dehydrated, it's in for some pain. For each action that a Pokémon with dry skin spends in a very dehydrating environment (think ""desert"") or under the influence of sunny day, it loses 1% HP. In addition, it is now weak to fire, and this fire weakness stacks with all other weaknesses it might already experience to that element (thus a parasect with dry skin is 8x weak to fire attacks)."
88,download,Download,,"This Pokémon's amazing powers of analysis and deduction allow it to instantly analyze its foe's strengths and, more importantly, their weaknesses. Upon entering battle, this Pokémon will scan one of its opponents and quickly deduce whether they are weaker to physical strikes or special attacks. It then reassigns the priority of the drivers that support its attack-type applications or special attack-type applications accordingly, resulting in a one-level boost in physical power if the foe has weaker base defense than special defense and a one-level boost in special power if the foe has weaker base special defense than defense. This boost is not a true temporary stat increase, however, and therefore a Pokémon with download may take a full six additional boosts for that particular stat, and the boost granted by download cannot be removed by haze or other stat-reducing maneuvers. It will also not simply wear off for any reason."
89,iron-fist,Iron Fist,,"Long and intense practice with punching attacks has left this Pokémon with an unnaturally tough fist. As a result, all punching attacks used by this Pokémon have their base power increased by 20."
90,poison-heal,Poison Heal,,"This Pokémon is not only immune to poison but actually thrives off the nasty toxins that cause most living organisms harm. When this Pokémon gains the poisoned or badly poisoned status, it regains 1% health per action for normal poison and 2%, non-increasing, for severe poison as it leeches bizarre nutrients out of the foul liquid circulating throughout its veins."
91,adaptability,Adaptability,,"This Pokémon is a highly specialized creature, having become unusually adept at wielding attacks that share its elemental alignment. As a result, all attacks that this Pokémon uses that share its type get double the STAB bonus on damage, although unfortunately the energy cost to use any moves outside this Pokémon's expertise (that is, its type) cost an additional 1.2x as much energy to perform, as this Pokémon is less familiar with them."
92,skill-link,Skill Link,,"Considerable practice and refinement of technique has allowed this Pokémon to become unusually skilled in the use of ""chain"" attacks that require firing several volleys of weak projectiles or attacks. As a result, this Pokémon will always hit with the maximum number of these attacks possible to realize their full damage potential."
93,hydration,Hydration,,"This Pokémon's body is porous and best kept moist. During rain, it can absorb water through its skin to stimulate its natural healing abilities, such that it will be cured of all major status effects upon the advent of a rainstorm or their submersion in water and be instantly cured of any of these conditions should they be reintroduced while the rain is still in play or they are still in some body of untainted water."
94,solar-power,Solar Power,,"This Pokémon's metabolism goes into overdrive when the sun is shining brightly (that is, when sunny day is considered to be in effect), and power floods its system as its photosystems kick energy production into high gear. This upwelling of strength is so extreme that it actually damages the Pokémon with this ability by 1% per action that it remains exposed to the intense sun, but at the same time it increases the damage dealt by all this Pokémon's special attacks by 3%."
95,quick-feet,Quick Feet,,"This Pokémon, when moved to desperation, is quite capable of amazing footwork and considerably more speed than their normal lumbering gaits would suggest. When stressed by a major status condition, the base speed of Pokémon with this ability is multiplied by 1.5. This boost is applied even through paralysis, although all the speed in the world won't save the Pokémon with quick feet from being totally unable to move at times when ""fully paralyzed."""
96,normalize,Normalize,,"This Pokémon has the unique ability to shape absolutely all of its attacks out of normal-type energy rather than channeling the usual elemental types, while still managing to produce the same results. All of this Pokémon's attacks, damaging or otherwise, become normal-type, and damaging attacks therefore all gain STAB. In addition, due to the removal of elemental attributes, attacks like thunder wave can be used to paralyze ground-types and attacks like dig strike fliers or levitators. However, do note that there is still absolutely no way to poison steel-types or poison-types or burn fire-types, etc.--those immunities go deeper than simple elemental resistances (for example, steel-types lack circulatory systems as we understand them, and poison cannot therefore spread throughout their bodies)."
97,sniper,Sniper,,"This Pokémon has worked extensively on its aim so that it can consistently hit an opponent's weak point for more damage than if it had simply struck it by accident. When a Pokémon with this ability scores a critical hit against a foe, it gains an automatic damage bonus of 10% regardless of the base power of the attack it was using."
98,magic-guard,Magic Guard,,"A veil of virtuous power surrounds and protects this Pokémon, giving it total immunity to damage from all but the most straightforward of attacks. Thus a Pokémon with this ability will take no damage from leech seed, weather damage, spikes, or indeed any effect that is not caused by a directly damaging attack used by the opponent."
99,no-guard,No Guard,,"This Pokémon favors an all-out fighting style where defense is casually tossed aside in favor of total commitment to maximum damage. A Pokémon with this ability will do absolutely everything necessary to make its attacks successful, being reckless to the point of insanity in its attempts to land a solid hit. As a result, all attacks used by this Pokémon cannot miss regardless of all considerations--this Pokémon will even strike flying, digging, or diving Pokémon without fail. Such amazing ability comes at a price, however--such total disregard for defense leaves a Pokémon with no guard pitifully open to attack itself such that all attacks used against it will never miss, either."
100,stall,Stall,,"This Pokémon is incredibly effective at doing absolutely everything but actually attacking the opponent. It spends an inordinate amount of time ""assessing potential angles of attack"" or ""searching the tall grass for potentially deadly traps"" when it could be actually damaging its foe. As a result, this Pokémon always moves last within the priority bracket for the move it has been commanded to use, although if it uses mach punch or similar it will still move before Pokémon acting in the normal move priority bracket, and so forth. However, with all that time it spends in hesitation the Pokémon can't help but make some beneficial observations about its opponent, such that when it finally gets around to attacking the foe it is better able to pick up on their weak points, each of its attacks dealing an extra 1% untyped damage to their target as a result."
101,technician,Technician,,"This Pokémon prefers technique over power, and it has honed the performance of some of its ordinarily weaker moves down to an elegant art. As a result, for all attacks ordinarily base 60 power or less, the base power is multiplied by 1.5 in addition to all other multipliers. For example, if a scyther with technician were to use aerial ace, the attack's base power would be considered 90 instead of 60."
102,leaf-guard,Leaf Guard,,"When exposed to strong sunlight (that is, when sunny day is considered to be in effect), this Pokémon has the ability to regenerate its foliage, curing itself of any major status effects as infected plant matter is shed and new leaves, vines, etc. sprout to replace the damaged parts. This regenerative burst only takes place when intense sunlight is first brought onto the field, however; status effects caused after the sun has already brightened cannot be healed in the same manner unless the sunlight is allowed to fade and then brightened again. However, the power of the sun is so overwhelming that a Pokémon with this ability won't be able to use rest while sunny day is considered in effect, either."
103,klutz,Klutz,,"This Pokémon is terribly clumsy and just can't handle having to deal with complex gear or strange changes to their physical stature, however helpful they might be. As a result, a Pokémon with this ability will not be able to utilize any of the ordinary effects of the item it is holding, and nor will they be able to utilize it with fling."
104,mold-breaker,Mold Breaker,,"This Pokémon is ready to do absolutely whatever is necessary to land an attack on the opponent, resorting to extremely unconventional methods of fighting in order to squeeze some damage through. As a result, Pokémon with this ability totally ignore any abilities that their opponents have and which would normally prevent the Mold Breaker Pokémon's attacks from getting through to deal damage. As a result, Pokémon with Mold Breaker ignore Flame Body, Volt Absorb, Wonder Guard, Motor Drive, Water Absorb, and all similar abilities that would ordinarily cause its damage to be nullified, instead striking the foe for damage calculated as though those abilities didn't even exist."
105,super-luck,Super Luck,,"Pokémon with this ability have a sinister power over probability, such that things always seem to go subtly their way. They manage lucky strikes more often than they normally would, with the result that all their attacks are made in a critical hit domain one higher than normal."
106,aftermath,Aftermath,,"Even to its last breath, this Pokémon is ready to do whatever it takes to bring the foe down. If it senses that the end is near, this Pokémon will prepare a concoction of highly volatile gases and store them within its body, waiting until the foe at last comes near to spew them in all directions, causing a fast and very potent chemical reaction with the air and, ultimately, a moderate explosion. If a Pokémon with this ability is knocked out by a physical contact attack, the foe that made the attack takes an instant 15% untyped damage. If the foe fails to use a physical contact attack, however, the Pokémon with Aftermath will be unable to tell when they ought to release their final strike, with the result that this ability will fail to cause harm to the opponent."
107,anticipation,Anticipation,,"This Pokémon possesses excellent powers of observation and deduction, and through careful observation of its foes is able to tell when they're about to make a particularly nasty attack. As a result, this Pokémon will be able to prepare itself for super effective attacks launched by the opponent, bracing itself against damage. Pokémon with this ability suffer 3% less damage from super effective attacks made against them."
108,forewarn,Forewarn,,"This Pokémon has extremely well-developed powers of foresight and premonition, allowing it to realize when the foe is about to launch an especially damaging attack. If an opponent targets a Pokémon with forewarn with an attack with over 90 base power, all situational bonuses and multipliers taken into account, then this Pokémon takes 3% less damage from that attack, as it is able to brace itself for the strike or throw itself partially out of the way of the oncoming attack."
109,unaware,Unaware,,"This Pokémon has a maddening habit of paying no attention to what its opponent is doing whatsoever. It is entirely uninterested in foes pumping themselves up to look more intimidating or curling up to protect their weak points. This Pokémon will just keep motoring along without a care in the world for its opponent's displays. As a result, all stat increases on the opponent(s) are nullified when a Pokémon with unaware comes onto the field, with the exception of speed--it's impossible to deny when another Pokémon is able to run rings around you without breaking a sweat!"
110,tinted-lens,Tinted Lens,,"This Pokémon has the ability to subtly alter the performance of its attacks such that they slip around foe's resistance to them unhindered, as they add a faint tint of some unrelated elemental energy to each attack they make. Thus, if the target of one of this Pokémon's attack would ordinarily have resistance to that attack, they are considered to have one less level of resistance than normal. For example, if a Pokémon were resistant to psychic-type attacks, a psychic attack made against it by a Pokémon with tinted lens would do normal damage. This ability cannot overcome total immunities, however, nor can it add extra power to an attack that the foe would not ordinarily resist at least slightly."
111,filter,Filter,,"This Pokémon has extremely selective perceptions of reality, and as a result it is able to screen out some of the extra pain caused it by attacks that prey upon its elemental weaknesses. As a result, rather than taking 1.5x damage from a super effective attack, it takes just 1.3x more damage, while it takes only about 1.6x as much damage from attacks that would normally trouble it twice as much as normal."
112,slow-start,Slow Start,,"This Pokémon is uncommonly sluggish and lethargic upon entering battle, as it takes a while for its body to react to the situation and gear up properly for the fight. As a result, this Pokémon's base speed and the base power of its physical attacks are halved for the first five actions in which it is present on the battlefield as it slowly warms up to its situation. However, after these five actions, the true power of this Pokémon becomes apparent and all its physical attacks have their base power increased by 10."
113,scrappy,Scrappy,,"This Pokémon is so determined to fight that it won't let anything, not even creepy semisolidity, prevent them from putting up a fight. So tenacious is a Pokémon with this ability that it can overcome all fears and physical limitations in order to actually damage ghost-types with normal- and fighting-type attacks. These Pokémon still retain their immunities to ghost-type attacks, but offensively the ghost-type is treated as totally nonexistant, such that fighting-type attacks used on a sableye cause super effective damage, for example."
114,storm-drain,Storm Drain,,"Pokémon with this ability have such an affinity for water that it will always run directly towards them, no matter where it was originally aimed, and are also able to soak up water attacks and use them to restore their inner reserves. All water attacks launched by any Pokémon will always strike a Pokémon with this ability so long as it remains on the field, regardless of team alliances or original targets. Water attacks also have no effect on Pokémon with this ability, and if struck by one, their special attack will rise by one level."
115,ice-body,Ice Body,,"This Pokémon's body sports an icy outer coating, and during a hailstorm any damage to this chilly layer will be restored as hailstones fuse to it. As a result, this Pokémon will regain 2% health for each action it spends exposed to hail."
116,solid-rock,Solid Rock,,"This Pokémon's incredible armor is of a composition like no other, so incredibly tough and thick that almost nothing can get through it, not even the elemental powers that would ordinarily cause it harm. As a result, rather than taking 1.5x damage from a super effective attack, it takes just 1.3x more damage, while it takes only about 1.6x as much damage from attacks that would normally trouble it twice as much as normal."
117,snow-warning,Snow Warning,,"This Pokémon wields an arcane power over the weather, bringing cloudy skies and pelting hail with it wherever it goes. Hail is triggered when this Pokémon is brought onto the field, and it will continue indefinitely even after the Pokémon leaves the field for any reason. However, the weather may be changed while this Pokémon is on the field, and the hail will not return after the other weather effect has ended unless the Pokémon with Snow Warning is recalled and sent out again. This ability has no effect indoors or in areas where weather is normally banned completely, or where only hail is excluded."
118,honey-gather,Honey Gather,,"This Pokémon is adept at finding and collecting honey, and it will, over the course of the battle, be able to collect a small amount of the precious, delicious substance unless sent into an environment totally devoid of plantlife. In addition, it may be commanded to actively seek out honey as an action during battle instead, with the result that it will collect one unit of the stuff per action, if possible, instead of making some attack. The sale of this honey nets this Pokémon's trainer an additional $2 per unit at the end of the battle, with profit from this ability not to exceed $5 per battle."
119,frisk,Frisk,,"A Pokémon with this ability, in times of relative calm, can use its dark powers to shake down its opponents for information about their plans, badgering them into spilling the beans just before the first round begins. As a result, whenever a Pokémon is sent into a battle where a Pokémon with the frisk ability is either already on the field or has already been sent out, with no commands given, then that Pokémon's trainer must always give commands to all of their Pokémon before the trainer with the Pokémon with frisk, on the round when their Pokémon is first sent out only."
120,reckless,Reckless,,"This Pokémon is exhilarated by danger and doesn't hesitate to sacrifice personal safety in favor of dealing more damage. As a result, it throws its best effort into the most risky attacks, and attacks that it uses that may cause recoil damage (including jump kick and hi jump kick) have their power increased by 1.2x."
121,multitype,Multitype,,"This otherworldly Pokémon is aligned with every elemental type in existence such that it has no weaknesses, no resistances or immunities, and STAB on every attack it uses."
122,flower-gift,Flower Gift,,"This Pokémon requires the warmth and energy of sunlight in order to stimulate its metabolism and generate the energy necessary to sustain itself in its most powerful form. When exposed to intense sunlight, it perks up considerably, unlocking its inner powers and converting to its most cheerful form. While experiencing the effects of strong sunlight, this Pokémon produces a special scent that invigorates the Pokémon around it, resulting in a one-level boost to attack and special defense for the Pokémon with this ability and all its allies for as long as the strong sunlight is in effect. This boost is not a true temporary stat increase, however, and therefore all Pokémon affected by Flower Gift may take a full six additional boosts for the affected stats, and the boosts granted by Flower Gift cannot be removed by haze or other stat-reducing maneuvers so long as the sunlight remains strong."
123,bad-dreams,Bad Dreams,,This Pokémon's very presence is so awful that it brings nightmares to the minds of all Pokémon near it. Any Pokémon that is asleep while a Pokémon with this ability is in play take 3% typeless damage per action that they continue to slumber as their mind is ravaged by terrible bad dreams.
124,pickpocket,Pickpocket,,"This Pokémon is a master pickpocket and able to slip a tantalizing piece of loot away from a foe even while it's getting beaten to a pulp. If a Pokémon with this ability isn't holding an item when another Pokémon makes contact with it, it will steal that Pokémon's item, if any. The item is returned to its owner at the end of battle as per usual etiquette and much to the pickpocket Pokémon's dismay."
125,sheer-force,Sheer Force,,"This Pokémon has no care for subtlety or chancy gambits, preferring to brute force its way through battle. It doesn't waste time trying to add fancy extra effects to its attacks when it could just use that energy to pile on even more damage. If a Pokémon with this ability uses an attack that would ordinarily have a side effect with a less-than-100% chance of occurring, that side effect will never occur but the attack's power is multiplied by 1.3x."
126,contrary,Contrary,,This Pokémon seems to respond in exactly the opposite way one would expect to the events of battle. A Pokémon with this ability has its stats boosted by attacks that would ordinarily lower them and vice versa.
127,unnerve,Unnerve,,"This Pokémon is so unnerving--whether because it is terrifying, kind of gross, or unsettling in some other way--that Pokémon fighting against it will find that they've completely lost their appetites. As a result, any Pokémon in battle against a Pokémon with this ability will not be able to consume berries or use swallow until it leaves the battlefield."
128,defiant,Defiant,,"This Pokémon refuses to buckle in the face of hardship, with every setback only increasing its determination to win. When a Pokémon with this ability has one or more of its stats lowered by another Pokémon, its attack greatly increases."
129,defeatist,Defeatist,,"Although a fearsome fighter when things are going well, this Pokémon is prone to simply giving up when the tide turns and the battle becomes difficult. As long as a Pokémon with this ability is below 50% health, all its attacks have their base power cut in half. A Pokémon that's no longer trying can't be disappointed, however, and as a result a Pokémon with this ability will also be immune to having its stats lowered by the opponents as long as it remains below 50% health."
130,cursed-body,Cursed Body,,"This Pokémon has the protection of dark powers unknown that will occasionally intervene to aid it in battle by casting a curse on attacks that damage it. Whenever an attack successfully strikes a Pokémon with this ability, even if it isn't a contact move and even if it knocks the Pokémon out, there is a 30% chance that this ability will trigger and cause the attack to be disabled. The disabling effect is identical to that of the move disable."
131,healer,Healer,,"This Pokémon does its best to aid its allies with its healing powers, though it is often too busy looking after itself and can only reach those in near proximity. At the end of each round, if a Pokémon with this ability is within two meters of any of its allies, there is a 30% chance that it will heal each of them of any major status conditions with which they are afflicted."
132,friend-guard,Friend Guard,,"This Pokémon hates having to harm its allies, and will do anything within its power from preventing them from taking the full force of its attacks. If a Pokémon with this ability would harm any ally with one of its attacks, whether through direct targeting or as collateral damage in a multi-target attack, the ally will take only 0.75x the normal amount of damage."
133,weak-armor,Weak Armor,,"This Pokémon's armor or outer covering is unfortuntately underdeveloped relative to some other members of its species and has a tendency to fracture and break off when exposed to stress. As a result, whenever a Pokémon with this ability is struck by a damaging attack, its defense will drop by one level as a piece of its armor is shed. However, the reduced weight associated with this loss of armor also means that its speed rises by one level each time that a piece falls off."
134,heavy-metal,Heavy Metal,,"The metallic parts of this Pokémon's body are composed of a much denser alloy than manufactured by some others of its species. A Pokémon with this ability weighs twice as much as the average for its species, but is also very sturdy and resistant to physical damage. As a result, it takes 1% less damage from all physical attacks."
135,light-metal,Light Metal,,"The metallic portions of this Pokémon's body are made of a much less dense alloy than those on some individuals in its species. As a result, a Pokémon with this ability weighs half as much as the average for its species. Its reduced weight also lends it slightly greater mobility, and it counts as having 20 points more base speed than the average individual of its species."
136,multiscale,Multiscale,,"This Pokémon has a layer of tough outer scales that initially protect it against damage, though they're useless once they've been breached. If a Pokémon with this ability is at full health, attacks made against it have their damage halved."
137,toxic-boost,Toxic Boost,,"Although not immune to poison's damaging effects, this Pokémon has developed the ability to mobilize its body's full strength in response to being poisoned, letting it fight at full power for whatever time it has left. So long as a Pokémon with this ability is poisoned, the power of all its damaging attacks is multiplied by 1.5x, but they cost 1.2x as much energy to use."
138,flare-boost,Flare Boost,,"This Pokémon is able to rise above the pain caused by a burn and draw on the residual fire energy residing within it. As long as a Pokémon with this ability is burned, the power of all its special attacks is increased by 1.5x, but they cost 1.2x as much energy to use."
139,harvest,Harvest,,"This Pokémon keeps a private stash of berries to provide for itself in battle. If a Pokémon with this ability was holding a berry at the start of a round and has used it by the end of the round, it will produce another berry of the same type and begin holding it. If the conditions for it to eat the berry are fulfilled at the time it is produced, the Pokémon will eat it immediately, gain its effect, and not be able to produce any more berries for the duration of the battle."
140,telepathy,Telepathy,,"This Pokémon establishes a telepathic link with its allies whenever it is sent into battle, allowing it to roughly anticipate their intentions. As a result, a Pokémon with this ability will always be able to get out of the way of its allies' attacks, with the result that it will avoid all damaging attacks used by allies that might otherwise strike it."
141,moody,Moody,,"This Pokémon is highly prone to fits of temper and strange mood swings; in fact, its disposition seems in a constant state of flux and hardly related to its battle situation at all. At the end of each round, a Pokémon with this ability will have a random one of its stats raised by two stages and another random stat lowered by another stage as its attitude towards the battle shifts. If a stat to be raised is already at its maximum +6 or a stat to be lowered is at -6, the raising or lowering simply doesn't happen; the stat to be raised or lowered is not reselected."
142,overcoat,Overcoat,,"This Pokémon has a tough outer covering that protects it from the elements and keeps it comfortable in all sorts of weather. A Pokémon with this ability takes no damage from sandstorm, hail, or any other weather-equivalent, regardless of its typing."
143,poison-touch,Poison Touch,,"This Pokémon can secrete poison from its pores, adding a toxic bite to its contact attacks. Whenever a Pokémon with this ability uses a contact attack on another Pokémon, there is a 20% chance that the victim will become poisoned."
144,regenerator,Regenerator,,"This Pokémon has powerful natural healing abilities and can quickly repair physical damage if given a bit of time to rest and replenish itself. If a Pokémon with this ability is recalled and then later sent back into battle, it will have recovered 5% of its HP for each round that it spent in its pokéball."
145,big-pecks,Big Pecks,,This Pokémon is totally confident in its abilities and unruffled by even the most strenuous attempts to make it drop its guard. A Pokémon with this ability cannot have its defense lowered.
146,sand-rush,Sand Rush,,"This Pokémon can manipulate the power of a sandstorm to lend it speed, calling on the raging winds to blow at its back and propel it into battle at a spectacular velocity. So long as a sandstorm is raging, a Pokémon with this ability has its base speed doubled."
147,wonder-skin,Wonder Skin,,"This Pokémon's very skin is imbued with a magical power that allows it to sometimes shrug off attacks that might otherwise alter its status. If a Pokémon with this ability is targeted by an attack with no other effect than to cause a major status, there is a 50% chance that it will fail."
148,analytic,Analytic,,"This Pokémon prefers to take it slow and pay attention to its opponent's moves. The more that it gets to observe, the better it understands its target and the more it can tailor its attacks to prey upon the opponent's weaknesses. Whenever a Pokémon with this ability attacks a Pokémon that moved before it in this action, its attack deals 1.3x more damage."
149,illusion,Illusion,,"This Pokémon is adept at using its sorcerous powers to shroud itself in illusions. When sent out, a Pokémon with this ability takes on the appearance of one of the other Pokémon on its team that is still capable of fighting. However, the illusion dissipates as soon as the Pokémon has been struck by a damaging attack. When a trainer wants to send out a Pokémon with this ability, if they still have any unfainted Pokémon in their reserve, they may PM the referee that they are sending out their illusion Pokémon, while posting in the thread that they're sending out one of their other Pokémon in reserve. Play will continue as though the Pokémon sent out was what the trainer claimed in the thread, although the referee will treat it as the illusion Pokémon for the purpose of all damage calculations, and it can only use attacks in its own movepool. A Pokémon impersonated in this way must later be used in battle if it hasn't been sent out yet. For example, take a 3vs3 battle where a player's first Pokémon has just been knocked out. They choose to send out their zorua with illusion next. However, in the thread they post that they're sending out their growlithe. If zorua is later knocked out, Growlithe must be the Pokémon chosen to replace it. As soon as the illusion Pokémon is struck by a damaging attack, the effect ends and the referee begins referring to it by its actual characteristics. If the Pokémon it was impersonating had already been sent out but was later recalled and has taken damage, this is not reflected in the stats of the Pokémon with illusion--its actual health and energy will be displayed. If the trainer has no unfainted Pokémon that aren't already on the field when a Pokémon with illusion is sent out, the ability has no effect at that time. Additionally, a Pokémon with this ability may spend an action to cast an illusion on itself once the battle has begun, and this illusion does not need to be of one of its allies, or even of a Pokémon at all; it can appear to be any living or inanimate thing its trainer can think of. However, the illusion is still broken if the Pokémon is struck by a damaging attack."
150,imposter,Imposter,,"This Pokémon is highly adept at quickly assessing and assuming its opponent's form. When sent into battle, a Pokémon with this ability will immediately transform into its opponent. If more than one other Pokémon is in battle, the one that it transforms into is random."
151,infiltrator,Infiltrator,,"This Pokémon is particularly adept at slipping around barriers and thwarting even the strongest defense. A Pokémon with this ability isn't affected by its target's reflect, light screen, or safeguard barriers."
152,mummy,Mummy,,"This Pokémon is enlivened by a hideous power, one that confers a curse on all who dare touch it. If a Pokémon makes contact with a Pokémon with this ability, all its current abilities are nullified and it gains this ability itself."
153,moxie,Moxie,,"This plucky Pokémon's confidence only increases with every success it has, and the better it does, the more it is inspired to try harder. Whenever a Pokémon with this ability KO's an opponent, its attack rises by one level."
154,justified,Justified,,"This Pokémon sees battle as an opportunity to punish the unrighteous, and it's just itching to find some evidence that its opponent is an infidel who deserves the beating it will surely receive. A dark-type attack, clearly a sign of untrustworthiness and alignment with evil, is just the confirmation it needs. As a result, if a Pokémon with this ability is struck by a dark-type attack, its attack will rise by one level as it eagerly redoubles its efforts to bring its foe to justice."
155,rattled,Rattled,,"This Pokémon is extremely nervous about being associated with the more unsavory elements of the Pokémon world. It becomes skittish and hasty to get the battle over with if it decides that its opponent is particularly unpleasant. As a result, if a Pokémon with this ability is struck by a bug-, dark-, or ghost-type move, its speed will rise by one level."
156,magic-bounce,Magic Bounce,,"This Pokémon emits a constant low-grade psychic aura that repels status- and mind-altering, non-damaging attacks, sending them straight back at its target. A Pokémon with this ability behaves as though it has the effects of magic coat permanently and without expending any actions to reflect attacks. Attacks that have been bounced once already cannot be bounced again and so will strike through other magic bounce abilities or magic coat attacks."
157,sap-sipper,Sap Sipper,,"This Pokémon is herbivorous, and its swift metabolism allows it to quickly extract energy from the plants it eats, while its adaptations to consuming plantlife have left it immune to their best attempts at hindering it. Any grass-type attack used against this Pokémon is no more than fodder for it to consume and convert to power for its future attacks. A Pokémon with this ability is completely unaffected by grass-type attacks, and if struck by one, its attack will rise by one level."
158,prankster,Prankster,,"This Pokémon delights in causing chaos and getting a laugh far more than it cares for actually damaging its foes. It's refined its tricksy, non-damaging attacks through constant practice and is able to pull them off at a blinding speed as a result. A Pokémon with this ability performs all non-damaging attacks at a priority level one higher than usual. Thus, if a Pokémon with this ability uses stun spore, it will have the same priority as quick attack; if it uses helping hand, it will always be able to use the attack before any other Pokémon can even think of moving, with the exception of other, faster Pokémon with the prankster ability."
159,sand-force,Sand Force,,"This Pokémon has masterful control over the ground element, allowing it to pluck energy from the very air during a raging sandstorm and use it to power its earth-related attacks. If a Pokémon with this ability uses a rock-, ground-, or steel-type attack during a sandstorm, that attack's power is multiplied by 1.3x."
160,iron-barbs,Iron Barbs,,"This Pokémon is studded with wicked iron spikes that are sure to injure any Pokémon unwise enough to touch them. If another Pokémon makes contact with a Pokémon with this ability, it takes 2% recoil damage, even if the contact was not as a result of a damaging attack. This recoil is not prevented by the rock head ability."
161,zen-mode,Zen Mode,,"While appearing uncontrollably aggressive to the untrained eye, this Pokémon in fact is highly in tune with its strength and quick to change its tactics when it's clear that outright power won't be enough to win the battle if things are going poorly. If a Pokémon with this ability is a darmanitan and falls below 50% health, it will transform into its ""zen"" form, a gray, egg-shaped form with none of its usual fiery character. While in this mode it is a fire- and psychic-type, all its special attacks will do 2% more damage, and it will take 1% less damage from all attacks. However, it will do 3% less damage with all its physical attacks, and its base speed is reduced to 55."
162,victory-star,Victory Star,,"This Pokémon's tenacity and unending thirst for victory inspire not only itself, but all its allies, to give the battle their all and make their every attack count. So long as a Pokémon with this ability is on the battlefield, it and all its allies have their accuracy multiplied by 1.1x."
163,turboblaze,Turboblaze,,"This Pokémon's natural furnace provides it with the constant stream of energy necessary to lend its attacks overwhelming strength. Their power is enough to overcome even the toughest Pokémon's defenses against them. If a Pokémon with this ability uses an attack that another Pokémon's ability would block or reduce the power of, the ability has no effect."
164,teravolt,Teravolt,,"This Pokémon's natural generator provides it with the constant stream of energy necessary to lend its attacks overwhelming strength. Their power is enough to overcome even the toughest Pokémon's defenses against them. If a Pokémon with this ability uses an attack that another Pokémon's ability would block or reduce the power of, the ability has no effect."
165,aroma-veil,Aroma Veil,,"This Pokémon has an overwhelming perfumed aura about it. Though the individual fragrance varies, its harshness brings a clear-headedness to this Pokémon and all of its allies. In the heat of the battle, it gives them a better cognition of their enemies, and they no longer fall for attacks that target their minds."
166,flower-veil,Flower Veil,,"This Pokémon has an extremely strong affinity with greenery, and a natural ability to heal plant-like Pokémon. As such, it can protect ally grass-types from stat reductions and non-volatile status problems inflicted by enemies. However, it cannot protect its allies from themselves, and self-inflicted stat reductions and conditions cannot be prevented by flower veil."
167,cheek-pouch,Cheek Pouch,,"This Pokémon has a long history of berries in its diet. Over time, its cheek pouches have adapted to holding them, and it has gained additional benefits to consuming them. When this Pokémon eats berries, it gains 5% health in addition to any other effect the berry might have."
168,protean,Protean,,"This Pokémon is particularly influenced by internal elemental energies. When preparing any move, its elemental energy spreads through the Pokémon's body and changes it. As a result, the Pokémon changes to the type of the move it will use.  This is particularly useful for damaging moves, as it means the Pokémon will always get STAB."
169,fur-coat,Fur Coat,,"This Pokémon's fur coat is fluffy, thick, and extremely dense, so any physical attack it takes is padded. The damage of any physical attack hitting this Pokémon is lowered by 1% as a result."
170,magician,Magician,,"This Pokémon is skilled in using magic tricks: making things appear and disappear, pulling Buneary out of hats, what have you. It puts this ability to use in battle, rather jerkishly, by stealing things. When it successfully hits and damages another Pokémon, it uses the distraction of the attack as an opportunity to swipe the target's held item. The Pokémon with Magician can only do this if it doesn't already have a held item. Unfortunately for the sneaky Magician, the item must be returned to its rightful owner at the end of the battle."
171,bulletproof,Bulletproof,,"This Pokémon's shell is extremely strong and can protect it from projectiles. This Pokémon is immune to ball- and bomb-based attacks, in addition to other shot projectiles."
172,competitive,Competitive,,"This Pokémon has a driven, competitive spirit, and never gives up. Any setback merely drives it to work harder. When a Pokémon with Competitive has its stats lowered, its special attack goes up two stages in response."
173,strong-jaw,Strong Jaw,,"This Pokémon's jaws are incredibly strong. As a result, the base powers of all biting moves used by this Pokémon are multiplied by 1.33."
174,refrigerate,Refrigerate,,"This Pokémon is chilly right down to its bones, and the air surrounding it is always bitterly cold. The ice from within influences its attacks so that any Normal-type move becomes Ice-type.  Not only does this mean that Ice-type users will get STAB, but any move changed by this ability will also get a flat +2% damage bonus."
175,sweet-veil,Sweet Veil,,"This Pokémon constantly emanates a sweet, enticing smell that keeps its allies alert and drooling. As a result, it cannot fall asleep, nor can its allies as long as this Pokémon is within a 5 meter radius."
176,stance-change,Stance Change,,"This Pokémon has trained extensively in offense and defense, and has learned to adopt a different stance for each battle style. It certainly doesn't hurt that it has its own specialized offensive and defensive equipment, either. If a Pokémon with this ability is Aegislash, it will switch to its offensive form before executing any damaging attack and to its defensive form before using King's Shield. In its offensive form, it deals 2% more damage but takes 2% more from all attacks, while in its offensive form it deals 2% less damage but takes 2% less from all attacks. This ability is so inherent to the Pokémon that it cannot be copied nor replaced in any way."
177,gale-wings,Gale Wings,,"This Pokémon's wings are swift and true, and especially suited for performing flying-type attacks quickly. All flying-type attacks used by a Pokémon with gale wings gain one stage of priority."
178,mega-launcher,Mega Launcher,,"This Pokémon's main weapon is its cannons, and it is especially skilled at using them. The base powers of Aura and Pulse moves used by this Pokémon are thus multiplied by 1.33."
179,grass-pelt,Grass Pelt,,"This Pokémon's fur is woven through with many blades of grass. As long as Grassy Terrain is in effect, the blades strengthen, toughening up the coat and granting an inherent +1 in defense."
180,symbiosis,Symbiosis,,"This Pokémon is deeply in tune with the needs of its allies. Whenever its allies consume an item, it will immediately pass its own item to that ally as long as they are within a reasonable distance."
181,tough-claws,Tough Claws,,"This Pokémon's claws are reinforced and especially sharp, and it favours its claws when attacking. Because of this, the base powers of all moves that make direct contact are multiplied by 1.25."
182,pixilate,Pixilate,,"This Pokémon has such a deep well of Fairy-type energy within itself that it spills over when using Normal-type attacks. These attacks therefore become Fairy-type; not only does this mean Fairy-type Pokémon earn STAB when using them, but any move changed by this ability will also get a flat +2% damage bonus."
183,gooey,Gooey,,"This Pokémon is covered with a thick, gelatinous slime. The goo, being so sticky and viscous, inhibits the movement of other Pokémon and slows them down; as such, any Pokémon that lands a contact move against this Pokémon has its speed reduced by one stage."
184,aerilate,Aerilate,,"This Pokémon has such a deep affinity with the air that its elemental energy becomes the default. All Normal-type attacks therefore become Flying; not only does this mean Flying-type Pokémon earn STAB when using them, but any move changed by this ability will also get a flat +2% damage bonus."
185,parental-bond,Parental Bond,,"This Pokémon and its child share an exceptionally strong bond, and the baby is determined to help its parent out in battle. After all, if its parent is beaten to a pulp, who's going to provide the food? Immediately after the parent Pokémon attacks, the child performs the same attack on the same target. Given that the child is not fully developed, however, its attacks only have 0.33x the base power as those of its parent. The child's attack is calculated separately, consuming energy and being subject to all stat modifiers."
186,dark-aura,Dark Aura,,"This Pokémon gives off a powerful, sinister aura that encourages dirty fighting and evildoing for all nearby. The base damage of all Dark-type attacks is increased by 2% while this Pokémon is on the field."
187,fairy-aura,Fairy Aura,,This Pokémon gives off an extremely whimsical aura that promotes the magic and grace of all nearby. The base damage of all Fairy-type attacks is increased by 2% while this Pokémon is on the field.
188,aura-break,Aura Break,,This Pokémon is no-nonsense and has a balancing aura. It naturally removes the effects of Dark Aura and Fairy Aura.
