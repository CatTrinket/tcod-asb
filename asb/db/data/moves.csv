The ground shakes violently for a few seconds, and with repeated usage of this move the arena will become increasingly damaged as cracks spread out across the ground and pieces of terrain are toppled. Pokémon caught in an earthquake attack are thrown off their feet and slammed repeatedly into the ground as it bounces beneath them, and the damage dealt therefore depends on the hardness of the ground. In a sandy arena, the sand will absorb most of the shockwaves and also not make for a terribly hard landing for those Pokémon caught in an earthquake; in a solid rock arena, on the other hand, earthquake would be much more powerful.",Projectile
90,fissure,Fissure,9,1,,-1,30,0,1,"Deals damage equal to the damage cap, or 100% if there is none.","The user slowly tears open a huge crack in the ground with seismic activity. The walls of the chasm opened slide around as if attempting to swallow the opponent.

Costs 3% extra energy to do both in one action.","The user digs into the ground at an incredible rate, traveling at least five feet under the earth as they create a large tunnel.

As far as psychic attacks go, this one is fairly mild, although it may cause disorientation and confusion. In addition, confusion may be used to turn aside weak attacks or manipulate very small objects.",Projectile/Status (confusion)
94,psychic,Psychic,11,2,90,5,100,0,1,Has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.,"The user encases the foe in Psychic power and then throws and slams them about. Alternatively, the user may attempt to break into the opponent's mind and induce pain directly by stimulating the appropriate centers in their brain; mental intrusion is likely to result in a decrease in their resistance to subsequent breaches and cause a slight drop in special defense. Finally, this attack may be used to lift and manipulate fairly heavy objects at a distance, as well as manipulate or turn aside fairly powerful attacks.",Projectile/Stat modifier (special defense)

97,agility,Agility,11,3,,2,,0,5,Raises the user's Speed by two stages.,"The user leaps into action, running at top speed in order to loosen up its muscles and pump itself up for later rounds of battle. The speed of the Pokémon using agility increases dramatically, and it can more easily dodge attacks. Moves that strike quickly or hit multiple times have increased power when combined with agility; however, the burst of speed is only temporary and performing agility many timse in succession is extremely tiring. Agility can also be used to dodge attacks or cover ground more quickly rather than directly for the speed boost it grants.",Stat modifier (speed)

The enraged Pokémon will only become more so with each damaging attack performed against it while in its rampaging state, and as a result the base power of this attack rises by ten for each damaging attack suffered by the user when this attack is used consecutively. The user will calm down if this attack is not used repeatedly, and any base power gains will be lost.",Contact

The user retains use of the learned move for the duration of the battle, and no further moves may be mimicked in this manner. In addition, the use of a mimicked move costs slightly more energy than it ordinarily would, as the user is unskilled with the attack.",Special

104,double-team,Double Team,1,3,,-1,,0,5,Produces a number of illusory clones which act as decoys for single-target moves.,"The user dashes around the battlefield at top speed, leaving behind numerous illusory clones that mimic the user's every move. This attack can either be used to create a ring of clones around the target to greatly increase the accuracy of the next attack it performs, as the target will have no idea from what direction the strike will come, or simply to create a crowd of body doubles to confuse the foe so that they might end up attacking a clone instead of its creator. If double team is used to improve accuracy, the clones will all disappear after the highly accurate strike is made; otherwise, they will disappear only in response to damage or some circumstance that allows foes to see through the illusion. A Pokémon can control the number of clones that it creates, but producing more clones requires more energy, and the maximum number of clones it may produce is limited by its speed. A Pokémon of average speed can produce around five clones at maximum.",Special
105,recover,Recover,1,3,,-1,,0,5,Restores 50% of the user's health.,"The user glows brightly as it heals itself much more rapidly than it would by using rest. This attack heals large amounts of health as well as eliminating cuts and other wounds. However, it will not cure status effects. Although it restores a lot of health, this move requires a great deal of energy.",Healing (direct)

112,barrier,Barrier,11,3,,2,,0,5,Raises the user's Defense by two stages.,"The user generates a translucent wall of energy that greatly reduces the velocity of all solid objects that pass through it, thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of physical attacks used against the Pokémon sheltering behind it. This barrier stays in place and cannot be moved, and it may be shattered by a particularly powerful physical strike.",Stat modifier (defense)
113,light-screen,Light Screen,11,3,,-1,,0,8,Halves damage taken from special moves for five actions.,"The user focuses and creates a brilliant wall of light held in place by psychic energy. This screen scatters and disperses energy attacks made from the outside but allows those within to use such attacks without hindrance, thus greatly reducing the damage from special attacks sustained by the protected Pokémon. It takes considerable concentration to keep the light screen up, so if the user is startled or otherwise distracted the screen may fizzle before it would ordinarily fade away.",Special

115,reflect,Reflect,11,3,,-1,,0,8,Halves damage taken from physical moves for five actions.,"The user sets up a dome of shining golden energy. The dome may reflect beam attacks that strike it at a certain angle and greatly reduce the momentum of any physical object passing through it, thus greatly reducing the damage dealt to those who shelter behind it by physical attacks. The reflect shield will fade after several actions and requires a small energy investment for each action it remains in order to keep it active.",Special
116,focus-energy,Focus Energy,1,3,,5,,0,5,Raises the user's critical hit chance by two stages.,"The user concentrates and boosts its readiness for battle. This lowers the effect of moves that affect the mind (confusion, charm, etc.) and also helps to dispel illusions. Unless the focus is broken, the attacker, being more intensely aware of the battle, has a better chance of finding a foe's weak point and scoring a critical hit. The user's attacks are effectively made at two critical hit domains higher than usual after the use of this attack.",Special
